Run `node server.js` to run the server on localhost port 8081

HTTP requests can be sent to the server based on the API specified in the [Interface Specification Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNJLbXxi0g_cgOnHEjXZEuWhSY55yiNT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108168860311561889311&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Testing of the API is documented in the Test Case Document.

Some sample data is located on the second tab of the document, if you wish to send your own HTTP requests.
